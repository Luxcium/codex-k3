- [2025-06-02T12:35:00Z] Task: Python environment setup (local, Docker, volume, isolation) completed; All scripts, Dockerfile, compose, and documentation created per standards. See .github/instructions/python-environment.instructions.md for rules. Note: Executing Self-Documentation Protocol. This entry reaffirms that all actions and context changes must be documented and that this rule itself is part of the ongoing protocol.

  - Each agent now clearly understands its primary instruction file and collaboration boundaries

## What's Left

- Review all Memory Bank and .clinerules files for cross-reference and compliance with the new code organization standard.
- Verify markdown-lint compliance for all updated documentation.
- Communicate the new standard to all contributors and ensure script-driven enforcement.
- **Test AI Agent Framework:** Validate prompt files and instruction files in real development scenarios
- **Create Additional Workflows:** Generate domain-specific prompt files for common development tasks (Vue.js, API development, testing, etc.)
- **Audit File-Organization Instruction:** Review `file-organization.instructions.md` for self-referential state documentation and ensure front-matter and content align with autonomous self-documentation guidelines
- **Review Prompt Templates:** Validate all `.prompt.md` files (including `instruction-creation-v2.prompt.md`) for leadership language, autonomy triggers, and self-updating state instructions
- **Markdown-Lint Audit:** Perform a strict markdown-lint compliance audit across all documentation and scripts
- **Cross-Reference Compliance Review:** Verify cross-file references and dependencies in `.clinerules/` and `memory-bank/` files for completeness and accuracy
- **AI Framework Testing:** Conduct real-world tests of the AI Agent Framework workflows, including prompt and instruction generation and state updates
- **Contributor Communication:** Document and disseminate the new standards, procedures, and scripts to all contributors
- **Documentation Examples:** Create concrete usage examples showcasing the end-to-end autonomous workflow with AI agents
- **Finalize Self-Review:** Incorporate this comprehensive stateful review into `progress.md` as the final task before closing this initiative
- **Documentation Examples:** Create concrete usage examples showing the framework in action with different AI tools
- ✅ **Updated Prompts README:** Comprehensive update to `.github/prompts/README.md` reflecting all 13 prompt files with proper categorization and cross-references
- ✅ **Updated Instructions README:** Comprehensive update to `.github/instructions/README.md` reflecting all 10 instruction files with logical grouping and enhanced cross-references

## Current Status

- Code organization standard is now documented and enforced across architectural and technical documentation.
- **AI Agent Framework is complete and ready for production use**
- Remaining work is focused on propagation, verification, communication of standards, and practical application of the AI framework
- All core infrastructure for AI-assisted development is in place and documented

## Known Issues

- Document bugs, blockers, or technical debt here.

## Compliance with Project Setup Rules

- **All setup and file/folder creation must be performed via scripts in the `scripts/` directory, never manually.**
- **Scripts must be idempotent, must not overwrite existing files, and must warn or skip if files/folders exist.**
- **All rules and intentions must be documented in the README before implementation.**
- **The README and all scripts must remain markdown-lint strict mode compliant at all times.**

## Dependencies and Relationships

- **Depends On:** _[List upstream dependencies, e.g., activeContext.md, techContext.md, etc.]_
- **Required By:** _[List downstream dependencies, if any]_
- **Why This Order:** _[Explain why progress.md depends on active context and technical context]_
- **Impact Analysis:** _[Describe what happens if this file is not kept up to date or if dependencies change]_

## Call to Action

> **All agents and contributors must review, update, and self-regulate this file as progress is made.**  
> **Do not proceed with new work or mark tasks as complete until this file accurately reflects the current project status.**  
> **Update this file immediately upon any change in progress, status, or known issues.**

## AI Agent Instructions

This project supports three AI agents with specific entry points:
- **Cline AI** → `.clinerules/main-rules.md` (Cline AI's primary instruction file)
- **Codex CLI** → `AGENTS.md` (Codex CLI's primary instruction file)
- **VS Code Copilot** → `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (VS Code Copilot's primary instruction file)

**See [.clinerules/process-evolution.md](../.clinerules/process-evolution.md), [.clinerules/verification.md](../.clinerules/verification.md), and [.clinerules/learning-journal.md](../.clinerules/learning-journal.md) for required protocols and self-regulation guidance.**

## Current Focus: Autonomous Development Workflow

Based on conversation analysis (Pairs 03-05), implementing:

1. **Autonomous State Management**
   - AI agents automatically update project state via `autonomous-state-manager.sh`
   - Self-regulating system tracks changes and dependencies
   - Configuration-driven by prompts and scripts

2. **Multipurpose Initialization Templates**
   - Root-level `init/` folder contains reusable templates
   - AI agents can create new features, modules, or entire project segments
   - Template-driven development from scratch to monolithic projects

3. **Intelligent Prompt Creation**
   - Enhanced decision logic for when AI agents should create prompts
   - Context-aware analysis of project needs
   - Automatic cross-referencing and dependency tracking

### Latest Integration: AI Decision Logic (Pair 06)
- **AI Prompt Creation Instructions**: Complete decision-making framework for when/how AI agents create prompts
- **Trigger Recognition System**: AI agents recognize explicit prompt requests vs. immediate tasks
- **Intent Analysis Protocol**: Systematic approach to determine prompt characteristics
- **Decision Tree Implementation**: Mode selection (agent/edit/ask) and tool selection logic
- **Production-Ready Templates**: TypeScript component prompt as working example
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Project-specific patterns for TypeScript/Python/NextJS/Shell

### Autonomous State Management Status
- ✅ **autonomous-state-manager.sh**: Automatically tracks and updates project state
- ✅ **Multipurpose Init System**: Templates for AI-driven component creation
- ✅ **Enhanced Prompt Generator**: Includes AI decision-making logic from Pair 06
- ✅ **AI Agent Instructions**: Complete framework for on-demand prompt creation
