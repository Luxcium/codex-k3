# systemPatterns.md

## Purpose
This file documents the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, and component relationships for any project. It serves as a living reference for how the system is structured and how its parts interact, independent of any specific project topic at initialization.

## Structure
- **Architecture Overview:** General structure and organization principles.
- **Key Technical Decisions:** Rationale for major choices.
- **Design Patterns:** Patterns and conventions to be followed.
- **Component Relationships:** How parts of the system interact.
- **Call to Action:** Instructions for agents to update and self-regulate this file.

## Architecture Overview

This Memory Bank is initialized to provide a clear, adaptable template for documenting system architecture and patterns. It is designed to be updated as soon as a project context or architecture is defined.

## Key Technical Decisions

- All major technical decisions must be documented here.
- Rationale for each decision should be clear and accessible.
- Updates must be made as the system evolves.

## Design Patterns

- Use established patterns and conventions where possible.
- Document any deviations or custom patterns.
- Ensure consistency across all components.

## Component Relationships

- Clearly describe how components interact and depend on each other.
- Update this section as new components are added or relationships change.

## Call to Action

> **All agents and contributors must review, update, and self-regulate this file as the system architecture and patterns evolve.**  
> **Do not proceed with system-level changes until this file is aligned with the current architecture.**  
> **Update this file immediately upon any change in system structure, patterns, or technical decisions.**
