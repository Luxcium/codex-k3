# Docker Workflow Documentation

## Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive workflow for creating and managing Docker containers with a custom Docker Compose approach. It is designed to be replicated by other AI agents and human collaborators.

## Scope

- Custom Docker container creation and configuration
- Exotic Docker Compose implementation approach
- Workflow documentation for AI agent replication
- Container orchestration patterns
- Development environment setup

## Core Requirements

- All Docker configurations must be version-controlled
- Containers must be designed for development and production use
- Documentation must enable complete workflow replication
- Follow infrastructure-as-code principles
- Implement proper security practices

## Workflow Overview

### Phase 1: Container Design and Planning
1. Define container requirements and dependencies
2. Design custom Docker Compose architecture
3. Plan container networking and volume strategies
4. Document security considerations

### Phase 2: Docker Container Creation
1. Create base Dockerfiles for each service
2. Implement custom configuration management
3. Set up development and production variants
4. Test container builds and functionality

### Phase 3: Exotic Docker Compose Implementation
1. Implement custom Docker Compose patterns
2. Configure service orchestration
3. Set up environment-specific overrides
4. Test full stack deployment

### Phase 4: Documentation and Replication Guide
1. Document complete setup procedures
2. Create troubleshooting guides
3. Provide examples and use cases
4. Validate workflow with fresh environment

## Dependencies

- **Depends On:** 
  - projectbrief.md (core project requirements)
  - systemPatterns.md (architectural patterns)
  - techContext.md (technical context)
- **Required By:**
  - Development environment setup
  - Production deployment procedures
  - CI/CD pipeline configuration
- **Why This Order:** Docker workflow must align with project architecture and technical requirements
- **Impact Analysis:** Changes to this workflow affect entire development and deployment process

## Next Steps

1. Define exotic Docker Compose approach specifics
2. Create container architecture diagrams
3. Implement base Docker configurations
4. Document step-by-step replication procedures
