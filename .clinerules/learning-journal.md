# Learning Journal

## Pattern Recognition

- Memory Bank files are interconnected; changes must be propagated across files.
- Documentation must precede implementation.
- Script-driven changes ensure consistency and traceability.

## Process Evolution

1. Read ALL Memory Bank files first.
2. Plan changes across affected files.
3. Update documentation before implementation.
4. Use scripts for all changes.
5. Verify compliance and cross-references.

## Known Challenges

- Maintaining cross-file consistency.
- Ensuring complete documentation coverage.
- Following strict script-driven approach.
- Keeping all files markdown-lint compliant.

## Guidance

- Use this journal to log new patterns, challenges, and lessons learned.
- Reference this file in progress.md, activeContext.md, and all Memory Bank compliance sections.

#### [2025-06-23] Linting Infrastructure Implementation

Impact: Established comprehensive automated code quality enforcement with VS Code integration, pre-commit hooks, and mandatory formatting standards. This foundational infrastructure ensures consistent code quality across all contributors and AI agents, preventing quality regressions and maintaining professional standards. The quality gate pattern prevents non-compliant code from progressing through the development pipeline.

Pattern Components:

- Configuration files moved from staging (`files/`) to project root
- VS Code settings enhanced with format-on-save and linting integration
- Pre-commit hooks block commits that don't meet quality standards
- Automated setup script (`setup-linting.sh`) for infrastructure deployment
- Documentation standards requiring markdown-lint and prettier compliance

Learning: Quality infrastructure should be implemented early in project lifecycle to establish consistent development patterns. The quality gate pattern ensures all code meets standards before progression, reducing technical debt and improving maintainability.
